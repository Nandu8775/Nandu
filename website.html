     <p><b>Music</b>is the arrangement of sound to create some combination of<i> form, harmony, melody, rhythm,</i>or otherwise contetnt.<br> Music is generally agreed to be a cultural universal that is present in all human societies.<br> Definitions of music vary widely in substance and approach.<br> </p>
     <h5>Etymology and terminology</h5>
     <p>The modern English word 'music' came into use in the 1630s. It is derived from a long line of successive precursors: the Old English 'musike' of the mid-13th century; the Old French musique of the 12th century; and the Latin mūsica. The Latin word itself derives from the Ancient Greek mousiké (technē)—μουσική (τέχνη)—literally meaning "(art) of the Muses". The Muses were nine deities in Ancient Greek mythology who presided over the arts and sciences.They were included in tales by the earliest Western authors, Homer and Hesiod,and eventually came to be associated with music specifically.</p>

      <h5>Main article: Ancient music</h5>
      <p>The earliest material and representational evidence of Egyptian musical instruments dates to the Predynastic period, but the evidence is more securely attested in the Old Kingdom when harps, flutes and double clarinets were played. Percussion instruments, lyres, and lutes were added to orchestras by the Middle Kingdom. Cymbalsfrequently accompanied music and dance, much as they still do in Egypt today. Egyptian folk music, including the traditional Sufi dhikr rituals, are the closest contemporary music genre to ancient Egyptian music, having preserved many of its features, rhythms and instruments.</p>
